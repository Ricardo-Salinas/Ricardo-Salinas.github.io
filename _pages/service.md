Every photon counts for a modern telescope. To make the best out of changing weather conditions, modern telescopes are operated via *queue* mode, where appropriate observations are scheduled depending on the atmospheric conditions of each night.

Among my duties at Gemini are: queue coordination, queue observer, contact scientist, [Zorro](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/current-instruments/alopeke-zorro) instrument scientist, support for the [F2 MOS](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/current-instruments/flamingos-2) commissioning and  support for [GHOST](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/future-instruments/ghost) the new high-resolution spectrograph to be commissioned later this year at Gemini South.
