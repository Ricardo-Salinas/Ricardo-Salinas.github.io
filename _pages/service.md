Every photon counts for a modern observatory. To make the best out of changing weather conditions, modern telescopes are operated via *queue* mode, where appropriate observations are scheduled depending on the atmospheric conditions of each night. Therefore much of the planning and execution of observations relies on the Observatory staff.

Among my duties at Gemini are: instrument scientist for both [Flamingos-2](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/current-instruments/flamingos-2) and [Zorro](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/current-instruments/alopeke-zorro), queue coordination, queue observer, contact scientist, support for the F2 as multi-object spectrograph commissioning and support for [GHOST](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/future-instruments/ghost), the new high-resolution spectrograph to be commissioned later this year at Gemini South.
