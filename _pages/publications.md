The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) does a much better job than me tracking my publications. Follow [this link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy)&q=%20author%3A%22salinas%2C%20r.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)
to see a list of all of them.
