### Dark matter in elliptical galaxies


### Stellar variability in globular clusters

I have been working in and out on stellar variability in globular clusters since my undergrad thesis ([Salinas et al. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005IBVS.5640....1S/abstract),[2007](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007IBVS.5744....1S/abstract)), working towards a complete census of variable stars in these crowded environments *via* image subtraction ([Salinas et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157...47S/abstract)), with an special interest in the use of ground layer adaptive optics to pierce deeper into the dense centers of globular clusters ([Salinas et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152...55S/abstract)). Future work in this area includes a survey for short period variability in about 10 Galactic clusters using [NOT](http://www.not.iac.es/) and [SOAR](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/) data.

### Stellar variability masquerading as multiple stellar populations?

Intermediate-age clusters in the Magellanic Clouds present extended main sequence turnoffs that can be explained either as an extended star formation or as an effect of stellar rotation. In [Salinas et al. 2016b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...832L..14S/abstract) we propose that the extended TOs may be instead produced by Delta Scuti variables not properly assessed in *HST* photometry, theory we subsequently tested in the LMC cluster NGC 1846 ([Salinas et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..183S/abstract)).
